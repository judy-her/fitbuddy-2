## Project Requirements

### Development Approach

Fit Buddy was created from scratch, leveraging our experience from class projects combining our frontend abilities with React and backend expertise with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.

### Real-world Problem Solving

Fit Buddy addresses the real-world challenge of planning and tracking workouts effectively, focusing on user demand and data.

### Agile Development Methodologies

We followed agile development methodologies, including GitHub for version control, project management tools for task tracking, and Git branch workflow for feature and bug fixes.

## Standout Features

### CSS Styling

Instead of relying on CSS libraries like Bootstrap, we explored CSS-in-JS for maintaining styles at the component level, ensuring a maintainable and scalable codebase. While we did explore next-ui, taillwind css, but fond the timeline too short so we stuck with vanilla css to ensure we met the mvp.
